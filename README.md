# DotaDiscBot
 A Discord bot that will reply with a time countdown for a dota team's next match, get a list of upcoming/ongoing games as well as display the current dpc table standings.
 
 ## Commands:
- $nm (Number)- Returns the requested number of ongoing/next match to be played according to Liquipedia.

- $nm (Team Name) - Returns the upcoming match and time for the requested team.

- $table (CIS/CN/EU/NA/SA/SEA) (Upper/Lower) - Returns the Upper or Lower Division table for the requested region.

- $help - Gives list of commands.

Some team name exceptions: SG doesn't work whereas SG e-sports does, this is how the Liquipedia API works. So in case there is no response, try diferent variations of the team name.
